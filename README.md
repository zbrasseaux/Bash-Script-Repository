# Bash Script Repository

** This is merely a repository to house some of the Bash Scripts that I commonly use.

** They are pretty basic, but maybe someone will find these useful.

** All of the scripts (unless otherwise stated) are for the Linux Terminal, in Linux Mint 18.01 (Cinnamon).

-------------------------------------------

# MAC Address Finder

** Titled "get_mac.sh".

** The purpose of this script is pretty self-explanitory.

** Retreaves MAC adress for your primary wireless card and echo's it as a single line.

# Text to XML Converter

** Titled "txt2xml.sh".

** Converts text files into HTML, and then to XML, then saves it as a file with the .xml extension.

** Creates a directory for the text files and then moves said text files into the directory.

** Credit for this one actually goes to sgzUk74r3T3BCGmRJ from the Linus Tech Tips Forum.

---------------------------------------------

# Aliases

** Titled ".bash_aliases".

** A list of the common aliases that I use on a daily basis.

** To use these, save this file with this same name in your Home (~) Directory.

----------------------------------------------

# Compile ".java" files to ".jar"

** Titled "makejar.sh"

** Creates directory "./build"

** Compiles "*.java" to class files in "./build" directory

** Moves into "./build" directory and compiles all class files in the directory to a ".jar" file called "versionx.jar"
