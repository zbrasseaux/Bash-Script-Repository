# Bash Script Repository

** This is merely a repository to house some of the Bash Scripts that I commonly use.

** They are pretty basic, but maybe someone will find these useful.

** All of the scripts (unless otherwise stated) are for the Linux Terminal, in Linux Mint 18.01 (Cinnamon).

-------------------------------------------

# MAC Address Finder

** Titled "get_mac.sh".

** The purpose of this script is pretty self-explanitory.

** Retreaves MAC adress for your primary wireless card and echo's it as a single line.

# Text to XML Converter

** Titled "txt2xml.sh".

** Converts text files into HTML, and then to XML, then saves it as a file with the .xml extension.

** Creates a directory for the text files and then moves said text files into the directory.

---------------------------------------------

# Aliases

**Titles .bash_aliases

**A list of the common aliases that I use on a daily basis
